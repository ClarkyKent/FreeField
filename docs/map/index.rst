Map providers
-------------

FreeField uses basemap tiles from third party providers. Currently, Mapbox and
Thunderforest is supported.

You are required to set up one map provider in FreeField, otherwise the map will
not load. Instructions for setting up each supported map provider is provided on
the pages below.
