Discord webhooks
================

This guide will help you set up Discord webhooks in FreeField.

.. important:: You need the "Manage Webhooks" permission within the target
               Discord server in order to create webhooks on Discord.

.. note:: This page assumes you have read the general documentation on setting
          up webhooks, located on the :doc:`/webhooks/index` page. Discord also
          has specific documentation on webhook setup for end users in their
          `help center
          <https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668>`_. The
          FreeField documentation on Discord webhooks builds upon this article.

Creating a webhook in Discord
-----------------------------

1. Open Discord and find the channel that you wish for FreeField alerts to be
   posted in.
2. Open channel settings for the channel by clicking on ï€“ next to the channel
   name in the channels list.
3. In the "Webhooks" section in the dialog that appears, click on
   :guilabel:`Create Webhook`.
4. Give your webhook a name and optionally an avatar. The name of your webhook
   is what would normally appear as the username when a person talks in your
   Discord server.

5. Copy the webhook URL at the bottom of the webhook dialog, then click
   :guilabel:`Save`.

Payload syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for Discord webhooks to function, the syntax of the payload has to be
valid. Please refer to Discord's `developer documentation on webhooks
<https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook>`_ for information
on constructing a valid payload.

.. warning:: If your payload does not have a valid structure, it will silently
             fail.
