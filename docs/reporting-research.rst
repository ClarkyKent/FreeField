The next time someone clicks on the Pokéstop, the research task you just
reported will be displayed. Research tasks are automatically reset at midnight.

Reporting unlisted research objectives
--------------------------------------

Sometimes, particularly after research task rotations, the research objective
you want to report is not listed in the "Current objectives" section at the top
of the list of reportable objectives. You can still report the research task,
but you'll have to fill in more details about the research objective manually.

In the list of research objectives, scroll down until you find the generic
research objectives:

Select the research objective that matches the objective that you want to
report. The objectives are grouped into categories, such as "Battle objectives,"
"Catch objectives," "Throwing skill objectives," etc. Next, fill in the listed
parameters. For example, to report the "Evolve 5 Grass-type Pokémon," the
following can be entered:

Next, fill in the reward as usual and submit the report by clicking
:guilabel:`Report`.
