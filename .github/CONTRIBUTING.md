# Contribution guidelines

Thank you for willing to contribute to FreeField! This document details the
guidelines and requirements for contributing to FreeField. Any contributions
that do not adhere to these guidelines may be rejected.

For all contributions, please first discuss the contribution you are proposing
with the project maintainers by creating an issue detailing your contribution.
If you do not discuss your contribution with us and get approval first, your
contribution will likely be rejected. If your suggested contribution is of a
sensitive nature (whether by own judgement, or because it is listed in the
"Sensitive contributions" list below), you are encouraged reach out to the
project founder directly via email rather than creating a public issue - please
see the section below on sensitive contributions.

FreeField has a [code of conduct][code_of_conduct] for its community. Please
familiarize yourself with the code of conduct and follow it whenever you
interact with the FreeField project or its community.

When making code contributions, you should do your best to follow the code
standards and requirements described in the [developer documentation][dev_docs].
If you have any questions about these requirements, feel free to discuss it with
us by opening an issue on this project.

## Sensitive contributions

If you have an inquiry, request, or other contribution that can be described by
any of the following:

- Reports of violations of our code of conduct
- Legal inquiries
- Security vulnerabilities
- Inquiries involving one or a specific group of people or a community
- Other contributions you personally deem sensitive in nature
- Any inquiries you feel would be better handled in private

.. you should reach out to the repository owner in private, because those types
of inquiries are best and most efficiently handled on a one-to-one basis with
the project founder. Please contact the founder directly at marius@varden.info
regarding any such inquiries. All inquiries that are serious and in good faith
will receive a timely response.
